Heads up that the clarifai API has been updated since I made the next video. 
You will get an error using Clarifai.DETECT_FACE,  
it appears to have changed to Clarifai.FACE_DETECT_MODEL (Read more about it here: https://clarifai.com/developer/guide).

Also, the URL in the next video has also been updated. Keep this in mind as you go through the exercise:



app.models
.predict(
Clarifai.COLOR_MODEL,
    // URL
    "https://samples.clarifai.com/metro-north.jpg"
)
.then(function(response) {
    // do something with responseconsole.log(response);
    },
    function(err) {// there was an error}
);

 console.log (response.outputs[0].data.regions[0].region_info.bounding_box)
